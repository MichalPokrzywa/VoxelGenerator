The purpose of this thesis was to implement the procedural generation of a terrain
model containing flying islands in the Unity engine. The implementation includes terrain
creation, selection of a terrain model to generate, procedural terrain expansion, and allows
saving and loading of generated terrains. The final result of the project is presented in the
form of a Windows platform program that demonstrates terrain generation and parameter
modification capabilities.
